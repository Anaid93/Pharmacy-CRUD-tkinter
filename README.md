# Anaid Pharmacy
Anaid Pharmacy is an easy desktop app created from a python library called tkinter, which allows us to create graphical desktop interfaces. The app will also be integrated with a SQLite database, which we can control with a program called DB Browser for SQLite.
This app allows us to add, edit and delete products.

## Requirements

* Python 3
* SQLite
* DB Browser for SQLite
